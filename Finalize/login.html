  <h1>Fulfillment of Order</h1>
  <p>The online order submitted through this ordering platform will be fulfilled via delivery only. The delivery order is fulfilled either through Jollibee Delivery riders or other third-party delivery services which we may engage. We reserve the right to revise or add order fulfillment options in the future.</p>
            <h1>Submission of Order</h1>
            <p>Upon submission of your online order, you are authorizing us to process your online order and preparation of the Products you have specified on your order form. However, we reserve the right to refuse the processing of your order without any notification should we find any incorrect or incomplete details, or any previous spurious transactions with the given personal information.

                Also, non-response to SMS and calls from either store, or delivery rider may result to late or non-delivery of the Products and should not be taken against us. Additional verification call or confirmation call may be required to proceed with your order.</p>
  <h1>Regular Order</h1>
  <p>By submitting your order through this Site, you understand and agree that the processing of your order is subject to the following conditions:

    The minimum food purchase for a delivery transaction is P200.00.
    
    There is a forty-five (45) minute delivery guarantee for single receipt transactions amounting to P1,100.00 and below. However, this delivery guarantee does not apply if there are more than 20 orders per transaction of the same product combinations.
    
    If we are unable to meet the 45 minute guarantee, we will give you a P200 Jollibee Gift Certificate. You understand and accept, however, that any delay due to heavy traffic, inclement weather, unavoidable technical difficulties in the stores, or similar or conditions or circumstances, are beyond our control and should not at any time be taken against us. Delivery services may also not be available in cases of extreme weather, natural disasters, and unavoidable technical difficulties in the store/s in your area.
    
    For Orders amounting to P1,101.00 and up you will receive a call from our store to verify your identity and your order details.
    
    Due to the volume of the Products ordered, we do not guarantee that orders will be delivered within the 45-minute delivery period and the store will coordinate with you on the delivery serving time.
    
    Orders above P3,300.00, are considered bulk orders and will not be accepted by the Site. Instead, the Site will prompt you to call our Hotline #87000 to place your order.
    
    Excessive requests of items such as ketchup, gravy, utensils and the like are subject to store discretion.
    
    Any other special request outside the list of the Jollibee product menu is strictly prohibited. Additional special request such as medicine, newspaper, cigarettes, grocery items and the likes will not be entertained.</p>
               <h1>Advance Order</h1>
               <p>If you wish to order in advance through this delivery website, you may place your order at least two (2) hours before your expected delivery time.</p>
    <h1>Order Acceptance and Confirmation</h1>
    <p>The acceptance of orders for the Products made through the Site shall be at the entire discretion of Jollibee. We reserve the right to decline to accept the order or deliver the Products without giving any reason.

        Our acceptance of an order occurs when you receive an on-screen message or email message confirming that your order has been placed (“Order Confirmation”). The Order Confirmation is a record of our agreement to deliver the Products you ordered and your obligation to pay the price of the Products in full. The Order Confirmation will contain the following information:
        
        Your pertinent order number;
        The date and time of your order;
        The total amount payable;
        The address to which your order will be delivered;

        The contact number of the Jollibee store that has received your order.</p>
        <h1>Changes of Order</h1>
        <p>Changes in your order or delivery time can be made within five (5) minutes from the time that the order was placed, by calling the Jollibee store that received the order or by clicking “Message to Store” in the Order Confirmation page.
            If you wish to change your order prior to delivery, please call (through the contact number provided in the Order Confirmation) or message (through the “Message to Store” feature of the site) the Jollibee store within the timeframe stated above, and provide the details of your order included in the Order Confirmation. Changes in your order that are confirmed by the pertinent Jollibee store will reset the forty-five (45) minute delivery guarantee time, and will likewise be subject to these Terms and Conditions. You understand that the total amount of your order will be changed should there be any changes in your order, and that you agree to pay the new total amount upon delivery. Thus:
            If you paid for your order online via credit card, any additional price difference as a result of changing your order must be paid in cash, payable upon delivery.
If, as a result of any change/s you make to your order, the total amount payable is less than the amount paid online via credit card, any amount paid in excess of the new total amount payable shall be refunded to you by your own bank. You understand and agree that in such a case, we will not process the refund on your behalf, and that you are personally responsible for processing the refund with your own issuing bank.,
If you choose to pay by credit card upon delivery (card present), the total amount shall be chargeable and payable upon delivery.

If any of the changes to order include promotions which are only available for limited periods, any changes to your order may mean that the promotions are no longer available by the time the changes are made.

We reserve the right to refuse any modification in case the order has already been dispatched for delivery prior to receipt of your request.</p>
            <h1>Cancellation of Orders</h1>   
            <p>Orders may be cancelled within five (5) minutes from the time that the order was placed by calling or messaging the Jollibee store that received your order. Cancellation immediately after the 5th minute from the time that the Order Confirmation was received will no longer be valid. You understand and agree that cancellation beyond the 5th minute will require you to pay the full amount of the order placed by you.

                We reserve the right to refuse any cancellation in case the order has already been dispatched for delivery prior to receipt of your request.
                
                If payment is made via credit card and the cancellation of order was successful, it will be your responsibility to contact the issuing bank to cancel the payment made.</p>
